Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is among the most frequently performed procedures in the treatment of CAD. As an advanced form of PCI, drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation consistently reduces the risk of restenosis, but the ischemic risk remains. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), which combines aspirin and an oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, targets the reduction of ischemic recurrences. However, management of DAPT poses a dilemma in which prolonged duration could elevate the bleeding risk while short duration could increase the ischemic risk.

In this project, we developed a dynamic AI-based approach, AI-DAPT, which predicts the patientsâ€™ bleeding and ischemic risks after DES implantation in the context of DAPT either continuing or stopping. AI-DAPT was trained and validated using two large-scale real-world datasets, and it can be easily integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. This tool aims to support clinicians by offering precise quantitative insights to inform their clinical decisions, empowering clinicians to provide personalized DAPT duration recommendations, grounded in a dynamic and highly accurate risk assessment.

Our pipeline comprises data pre-processing, model development and evaluation (model selection, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, calibration), and visualization.
